            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a programming code that tells web browsers how to display a webpage's content. It's used to structure a web page's content, such as paragraphs, lists, images, and data tables. HTML also defines visual formats, provides search engines with page context, and designates sections of a page. 
                HTML is made up of a series of elements, also known as tags, that are written between less than and greater than symbols. For example, an element might label content as a heading, paragraph, or link. Some elements come in pairs to indicate when a display effect should begin and end. Tags can also contain attributes to describe content, such as adjusting the color of text or changing the destination of a link. 
                HTML is open source, free to use, and runs natively on every browser. Some say it's relatively easy to learn and has a clean and consistent source code. However, HTML has some limitations, such as being primarily used for static websites. For dynamic functionality, you might need to use JavaScript or a back-end language like PHP. HTML also has some browser compatibility issues, as some browsers may adopt new features slowly or not render newer tags.
